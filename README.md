🔹 Project Description

This project is a Docker-based HTML to PDF Converter application that allows users to generate PDF files from HTML content in a clean, isolated, and consistent environment. Instead of running directly on the local system, the application is packaged inside a Docker container, ensuring that all dependencies, libraries, and runtime configurations are handled by the Docker Engine.

Using Docker makes the project easy to run on any system without worrying about Node.js versions, library conflicts, or OS differences. Once the container is built and started, the application processes HTML input and generates downloadable PDF files inside the container environment.

🔹 How It Works

The user starts the application using Docker Engine.

Docker builds the image containing the application and required dependencies.

A container is created and run from this image.

HTML content is processed inside the container.

The application generates a PDF file and makes it available for download.

This approach ensures portability, stability, and ease of deployment.
